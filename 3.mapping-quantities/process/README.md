Description of the contents of this folder, a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the nuclear testing time series, and links to external data sources you'll be incorporating into
the project.
1. Co2 emmisons graph show Co2 emmisons of countries which has one of highest Co2 emmisions.
2. I initially hypothesized the correlation between military expenditure and GDP growth.
Tried to compare how GDP growth affect Military expansions,
3. Life expectancy graph, it shows how life expectancy changed for each country

I have looked up what if Nuclear weapon test would changed into something positive. I initially looked up how much moeny each countries spend for tests and compare with nuclear plant. But I could not find actual money for building nuclear plants.
I am trying to compare nuclear tests with how much NYC uses electrocity per hour.

I have came up with idea that even if total number of Nuclear stockfiles are dropping, number of nuclear states are increasing.
