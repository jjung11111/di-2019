Description of the contents of this folder and the logic of your data â†’ retinal variables mapping.
1. time shows based on a number of squares. blue shows seconds, purple shows minutes, and red shows hours. the number of squares increase by one square moving to rightside and duplicate. 
2. from outter circle, dots indicates hours, minutes, and seconds. The dots are not duplicated like the first one, but moving their spot to indicate times. 
3. like pendulum movement, each circles indicates time. For exmaple, once circle for hours hit the other end, it comes back. By the circle coming back, I tried to divide AM and PM.
4. each hemisphere has 12 dots to indicates AM and PM. Red lind and pruple line indicates minutes. the lines start from middle of the canvus and slowly elongated towards dots. when one line reaches to dot. the other line from the middle starts to enlongate toward next dot.

2-1. based on shape of moon, the moon will filled with yellow color. and depend on season, verticle box will be colored.
2-2. top left indicates day, top right indicates week, bottom left indicates month, and bottom right indicates year. each objects will be distributed randomly on each box.
2-3. I divided 12 sections on box to show callender. dots on the boxes indicates days. color also indicates different season.
